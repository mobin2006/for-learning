# hello.my name is mobin.today i want to explain about a for and work whit for.
# not at all.you are now thinking a for what is this.
# okay. the for is loop that makes your work easy.
# for example you want to get 100 number...
# you cant 100 times write the [a=int(input("please enter a number...."))]...
# no,no,no
# you can write:
# a = []
# number = []
# for a in range(100):
#     a = int(input("please enter a number..."))
#     print(a)


a = [x**2 for x in range(1 , 100)]
print(a)



# finisf,goodby
